A soft skill trainer for adolecents.

## Project Description

This project aims to create a mobile application game for adolescents to help improve their soft skills (as defined in Section \ref{def}) and provide educators with some insights around associated derived user data (see Section \ref{Scope}). Here, adolescents are defined as attending the final three years of high school or the first year of university, making them typically between 15 and 19 years old. Overall, the key objective lies in helping to service the demand for soft skill training. To this end, the games' design intends to ensure an enjoyable user experience for adolescents while providing meaningful feedback on their displayed soft skills. On a high level, users are presented with typical university and workplace scenarios via video, which require the application of soft skills. They are then asked to respond to the given scenario by choosing one of the suggested answers in a multiple-choice format and receive feedback on their displayed soft skills.
